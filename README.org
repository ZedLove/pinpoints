** TODO add links
  A small JavaScript application built with React and node to log points on a map.
  This project uses React Map GL to display a Mapbox map. The client gets data via \\
  a node backend connected to a MongoDB store. 
** Setup
   Ensure you have =mongodb= and =node= and =npm= installed
*** Server
    You will need to create a =.env= file based on =/server/.env.example=
    - =npm i= :: install dependencies
    - =npm run dev= :: run development server
*** Client
    - =yarn install= :: install dependencies
    - =yarn start= :: start local development server
** Current Functionality
*** displays a mapbox map centered around the Great Lakes
*** displays points (if any) from the DB
*** points have popups with more data
*** new points can be created via double-clicking the map
** Roadmap
*** TODO deploy server
*** TODO deploy client
*** TODO add more roadmap
