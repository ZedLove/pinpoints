* Pinpoints
  This project is currently deployed live, and very much work-in-progress, \\
  at: https://pinpoints-client.now.sh/. Please see the [[#roadmap][Roadmap]] for more information.
  A small JavaScript application built with React and node to log points on a map.
  This project uses [[https://uber.github.io/react-map-gl/][React Map GL]] to display a [[https://www.mapbox.com/][Mapbox]] map. The client gets data via \\
  a node backend connected to a MongoDB store. 
* Setup
  Ensure you have =mongodb= and =node= and =npm= installed
** Server
   You will need to create a =.env= file based on =/server/.env.example=
   - =npm i= :: install dependencies
   - =npm run dev= :: run development server
** Client
   - =yarn install= :: install dependencies
   - =yarn start= :: start local development server
* Current Functionality
  * displays a mapbox map centered around the Great Lakes
  * displays points (if any) from the DB
  * points have popups with more data
  * new points can be created via double-clicking the map
